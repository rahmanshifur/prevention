    content: `How does Primary Prevention work? It identifies risk and protective factors. Risk factors tell us about the likelihood of a negative outcome on mental health. Protective factors are things in our lives that reduce the impact of risk factors. Primary Prevention uses what's known about a community's risk factors and protective factors to create strategies and programs to decrease adverse health outcomes. It is an integrated approach. Rather than correcting potential health problems through a single program, Primary Prevention aims to improve outcomes through a series of strategies and actions.`,
    content2: `In practice, anything that creates a positive environment that keeps people from harmful behaviors in the first place can be seen as Primary Prevention. A community center, a park, access to healthy food, a doctor's visit, these are all forms of prevention. It is most effective when it includes citizen input, with an effort to mobilize communities to identify and address their local risk and protective factors. Investing in these creates healthier lives for the individual, stronger communities, and a brighter future for all.`,
    contentNext: `This approach offers personal and environmental solutions to health risks, creating better outcomes. Primary Prevention doesn't just impact health. It also saves taxpayers and state budgets by keeping people from entering costly systems like mental health and treatment facilities, the criminal justice system, hospitals, and healthcare institutions.`,

    content: `These can be easy to recognize or seem obvious. These include education about substance use. However, other seemingly less connected efforts can play a big role. For example, giving young people – an especially vulnerable population to substance use – the appropriate outlets can play a major impact. Community centers, playgrounds, libraries, after-school programs, and mentorship opportunities are examples of primary prevention as they give people alternatives to substance use.`,

    content: `Our environment can play a big role in whether or not we engage in substance use. Under-resourced or neglected environments can push people to use substances as a form of escape. As part of an effort to create communities that instill a sense of safety, pride, and hope, Colorado also makes an effort to build communities and create welcoming and positive environments. This can include planting trees, putting up street lights, installing bus shelters, and other small actions that improve a space.`,

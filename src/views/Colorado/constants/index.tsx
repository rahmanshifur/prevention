      'Primary prevention programs can be easy to recognize or seem obvious. These include education about substance use. However, other seemingly less connected efforts can play a big role. For example, giving young people – an especially vulnerable population to substance use  – the appropriate outlets can play a major impact. Community centers, playgrounds, libraries, after-school programs, and mentorship opportunities are examples of primary prevention as they give people alternatives to substance use.',

      'Our environment can play a big role in whether or not we engage in substance use. Hopeless environments can push people to use substances as a form of escape. As part of an effort to create communities that instill a sense of safety, pride, and hope, Colorado also makes an effort to build communities and create welcoming and positive environments. This can include planting trees, putting up street lights, installing bus shelters, and other small actions that improve a space. ',
